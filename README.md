# React redux todo app

Source code for a React redux todo app derived from a YouTube tutorial. Forked from the original author to use as an exercise in working with react and redux.  Includes

- Finished source code (app)
- An API

## Running the app

Clone the repo and run the following:

- cd app
- npm install
- npm start

**NOTE:** The API must be running in order for the finished code to work as intended. Seee "Running the API" below

## Running the API

The API is a dead basic node.js/express server, which stores the todos state in memory. Clone the repo and run the following:

- cd api
- npm install
- npm run server
- check its running by going to browser/postman

```
localhost:7000/todos

```
